# TFG: Algorithms for approximating a set from others. Mathematical Characterization and Experimental Study.
This repository contains the code, experiments, and materials of my Final Degree Project (TFG), titled “Algorithms for Approximating a Set from Others: Mathematical Characterization and Experimental Study”, completed as part of the Double Degree in Computer Engineering and Mathematics at the University of Granada (UGR), under the supervision of Nicolás Marín Ruiz and Daniel Sánchez Fernández.

## 🎯 Project Summary

Selecting the “best” approximation of a dataset is a fundamental challenge in computational science. In many real scenarios, such an approximation must be accurate, interpretable, and computationally efficient.
This project formalizes this idea as a set approximation problem by Boolean expressions.

The work has two main goals:

Theoretical–mathematical: formally characterizing the problem, studying its algebraic structure, its relationship with classic problems (such as SAT and Set Cover), and analyzing evaluation measures and its computational complexity.

Practical–computational: designing algorithmic approaches, implementing them in a modular and reproducible experimental environment, and validating their performance through controlled experiments.

A key theoretical result is proving that the decision version of the problem is NP-Complete, which justifies the use of heuristic and evolutionary algorithms to obtain meaningful approximations.
